# Place-Shoot-Basket
This is a basic-level engineering project that utilizes Newtonian mechanics without any electronic devices.
The goal is to make a basketball shot into a box.
The project involves applying physics principles and analyzing ball motion. 
Taking inspiration from golf, a compact and simple mechanism has been designed for these tasks.
As a result of this project, fundamental motion equations, collision physics, circular motion, and projectile motion concepts have been reinforced through practical applications and calculations.
This project has provided the first steps in implementing theoretical knowledge into real-life scenarios and problem-solving with an engineering perspective.
